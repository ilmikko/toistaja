Toistaja - A lätinätön Media Player


== Installation ==

As this is a web interface for VLC, you naturally need to install VLC for this to work.
You might also want nwjs in order to get a neat little window for the player.
Alternatively it works in browser, defaults to localhost:8080.

Clone the repository to the place you want it to be installed in.

`cd /opt`
`git clone https://github.com/ilmikko/toistaja`

Configure VLC as follows:

Go to Advanced Preferences under Preferences

Navigate to Interface > Main interfaces
Tick 'Web' to enable the VLC HTTP interface.

Navigate to Interface > Main interfaces > Lua
Under the box "Lua HTTP", set up the Password and Source directory fields.
(Password needs to match the password set in Toistaja's ./conf.json)
(Source directory is the absolute directory where Toistaja and ./custom.lua lie in)

And that's it, you have it installed!


== Running ==

In order to connect to the HTTP interface, you need to have VLC running in some way.
I prefer the headless version, because it can be run independently from the display manager.
So if you do

`cvlc ~/Music` (or wherever your music lies)

And then

`nw /path/to/toistaja`

And that's it! Enjoy!
